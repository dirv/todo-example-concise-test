# todo-example-concise-test

An example codebase that's used in the book [Build Your Own Test Framework](https://leanpub.com/byo-test/) (still a work in progress!).

##Â Getting started

The four steps are:

- [ ] Upgrade to (or install) the latest Node version
- [ ] Fork this repo and clone it to your local machine
- [ ] Create a new test runner project and link it
- [ ] Read the session overview section below

# Upgrade to (or install) the latest Node version

```sh
node -v
```

If Node isn't found, you'll need to install it. If the version is old, please consider upgrading.

### Fork this repo and clone it to your local machine

There's no requirement to fork as this repo isn't the one we'll be doing the most work in.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dirv/todo-example-concise-test.git
```

During the workshop we'll be modifying the file `test/tests.js`.

### Create a new test runner project

Most of the workshop will be writing code in a new NPM library. You can get a head start by doing all the plumbing beforehand.

1.  Open a terminal in your local workspace.
2.  `mkdir concise-test`
3.  `cd concise-test`
4.  `npm init` -- then fill in all the blanks
5.  `mkdir src test`
6.  Open package.json and add the following two lines:

```javascript
   "type": "module",
   "bin" : "./src/cli.mjs"
```

### Link the projects

The `todo-example-concise-test` project makes use of this new library you'll be building, so we need to link the two so it can be accessed.

Starting in the project folder of `concise-test` that you created in the last step...

1.  `npm link` -- this makes it available in your local package repo
2.  Change directory to the previous repo, e.g. `cd ../todo-example-concise-test`
3.  `npm link concise-test`

That's it.

### Overview

This workshop we'll be building out _both_ the `todo-example-concise-test` and `concise-test` projects.

The `todo-example-concise-test` project is like our scaffold, and will allow us to manually test the constructs we make in `concise-test`. As we build more and more features into `concise-test`, we'll update `concise-test-todo-example` to use those features.

You can see where we're going to end up by looking at the [`with-concise-test`](https://github.com/dirv/todo-example-concise-test/tree/with-concise-test) branch of this repo.
